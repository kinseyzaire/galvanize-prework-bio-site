    <p>Artist Kinsey Za&#239;re, born 1984 in Kansas City, Missouri was home schooled through the third grade and graduated elementary school in a polka dot dress and a mortarboard. Her family then relocated to Franklin, Tennessee where her father built and ran a recording studio, and she <strong>dropped out</strong> of middle school.
In 1997, the family relocated once more to Colorado Springs, Colorado where she <strong>dropped out</strong> of high school. She moved to New York and studied at Parsons, which she <strong>dropped out of.</strong> At 21 she moved onto London. A year later she <strong>dropped out</strong> of London and fell into Denver, Colorado; where she has resided for just over a decade. Her work in all forms bares the purity of deviance and exposes the dignity of wool gathering. Although predominantly a painter she works in all possible media including textiles, ceramics, woodwork, cosmetics, photography and now code.</p>
